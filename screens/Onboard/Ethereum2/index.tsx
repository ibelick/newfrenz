            ETH lets you be your own bank. You can control your own funds with
            your wallet as proof of ownership ‚Äì no third parties necessary.

            <p>
              Internet money may be new but it's secured by proven cryptography.
              This protects your wallet, your ETH, and your transactions.

            <p>
              You can send your ETH without any intermediary service like a
              bank. It's like handing cash over in-person, but you can do it
              securely with anyone, anywhere, anytime.

            <h3 className="font-bold mb-1">- No centralized control</h3>
            <p>
              ETH is decentralized and global. There's no company or bank that
              can decide to print more ETH, or change the terms of use.
            </p>

            <h3 className="font-bold mb-1">- Open to anyone</h3>
            <p>
              You only need an internet connection and a wallet to accept ETH.
              You don't need access to a bank account to accept payments.
            </p>

            <p>
              ETH is divisible up to 18 decimal places so you don't have to buy
              1 whole ETH. You can buy fractions at a time ‚Äì as little as
              0.000000000000000001 ETH if you want.
